**Summary**

*   "Little Sisyphus" is a physics-based platformer for the NES, where you roll a ball to the top of a mountain, collecting souls and dealing with falls.
*   Controls are simple: D-Pad for movement, A to jump, B to pull a pearl, and START+SELECT to respawn.
*   The game was developed in one month for the 2023 NESDev Compo using NESFab, MTPaint+Gimp, and FamiTracker.
*   The concept originated from a shelved game idea called "Stairville" and was influenced by a previous unfinished platformer project.
*   Physics implementation uses impulse-based physics for the ball and position-based dynamics for the rope.
*   The water effect uses NES color emphasis and a technique involving audio interrupts and sprite-0 hits to overcome cartridge limitations.
*   Developing with NESFab, the creator's own language, was a first real project experience, highlighting benefits in multiplication but challenges with ROM size limits.
*   The art style is inspired by ancient Greek pottery and the game Apotheon, utilizing a monochrome palette and AI-assisted art for the title screen.
*   Music composition was a struggle, resulting in one gameplay song due to time constraints and NES audio channel limitations.
*   The developer enjoyed creating the game and is hopeful for its reception in the NESDev Compo.
