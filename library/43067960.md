 "summary": "**Summary**\n\n*   The author discusses the unsettling nature of the number line, particularly the numbers between integers, dubbed \"disintegers.\"\n*   While integers might seem straightforward, even they are conceptually strange as we assign distinct identities to numbers that are practically indistinguishable in some contexts.\n*   The numbers between integers include fractions, but also irrational numbers like the square root of 2, which cannot be expressed as a ratio of whole numbers.\n*   Algebraic numbers, solutions to polynomial equations, widen the scope, but transcendental numbers like pi and e are not algebraic and can only be approximated through computational processes.\n*   The concept of \"number\" expands to \"things you can compute,\" but even this is insufficient as non-computable numbers exist.\n*   Non-computable numbers are abundant; in fact, almost every number on the number line is non-computable, meaning they cannot be fully described or computed.\n*   These numbers are beyond human comprehension in a practical sense, yet they constitute the vast majority of real numbers.\n*   The article concludes with Von Neumann's quote, suggesting we become accustomed to mathematical concepts rather than fully understanding them, highlighting the inherent strangeness of even basic mathematical ideas like the number line.",
