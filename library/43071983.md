**Summary**

*   The author experienced frequent sleep-wake crashes on their Linux desktop with an AMD GPU, especially under high RAM usage.
*   The root cause was identified as a bug in the `amdgpu` driver's power/memory management related to VRAM eviction during suspend.
*   During system sleep, the GPU's VRAM needs to be saved to system RAM, but if system RAM is full and swap is disabled too early in the suspend process, out-of-memory (OOM) errors and crashes occur.
*   Debugging involved analyzing system journals, disabling NVMe APST, using `pm_trace`, enabling systemd debug shell, and setting up a serial console for logging.
*   Initial attempts to fix the issue by moving VRAM eviction earlier in the suspend process were complex and not fully effective.
*   A Ghidra analysis of the `amdgpu.ko` module revealed a null pointer dereference bug that was also addressed.
*   A userspace workaround using `amdgpu_evict_vram` had limitations due to livelock issues.
*   The final and effective solution was to use Linux power management notifiers to trigger VRAM eviction during the `PM_SUSPEND_PREPARE` phase, before swap is disabled and disks are frozen.
*   This fix is merged into the `amdgpu` driver and will be available in Linux kernel 6.14.
*   An alternative userspace workaround called `memreserver` exists, which reserves system RAM to make space for VRAM eviction.
