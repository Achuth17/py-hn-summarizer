**Summary**

*   The author visualized the "thought process" of an AI model (R1) by animating its chains of thought.
*   This visualization process involves:
    *   Saving the AI's chains of thought as text.
    *   Converting the text into embeddings using the OpenAI API.
    *   Plotting these embeddings sequentially using t-SNE for dimensionality reduction.
*   The visualization aims to depict how the AI's thoughts evolve when answering questions.
*   The project also calculates and visualizes the "Consecutive Distance" between sequential thought steps to measure the magnitude of change in the thought process.
*   Combined plots and aggregate distances across multiple samples are presented to identify potential patterns in the AI's thinking.
*   Ten diverse prompts were used to generate the chains of thought and visualizations.
*   A JavaScript script ("pull_cot.js") is provided to facilitate extracting chains of thought from Deepseek's chat interface.
*   The code and data for the project are publicly available on GitHub.
*   The author suggests observing phases in the AI's thought process, such as "search," "thinking," and "concluding" phases, based on the visualizations.

**Discussion Summary**

*   **Critique of Methodology - Validity of using External Embeddings and Dimensionality Reduction for Representing AI Thoughts** (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43082533, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43082500, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43081798, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43082081, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43082197, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43082476, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43082028, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43082378, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43081801, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43082246)
    *   Concerns are raised about the meaningfulness of using OpenAI embeddings to represent the internal thought process of the AI model. It's suggested that the relationship between external embeddings and the model's latent space is minimal, and thus the visualization might be misleading.
    *   Critics argue that dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE distort distances and might not accurately reflect the relationships between thoughts, potentially resulting in visualizations that resemble random noise or a random walk.
    *   The use of cosine similarity on embeddings is questioned, as it may not capture nuanced semantic relationships between thoughts, especially in high-dimensional spaces where vectors tend to be orthogonal.
    *   It is suggested that analyzing the internal activations of the model itself would be a more direct and potentially more informative approach to visualize the AI's thought process.
    *   Some comments express skepticism about whether the visualization reveals anything meaningful about the AI's thinking, with some outright stating it is "useless" or "just plotting noise."

*   **Suggestions for Improvement and Alternative Approaches** (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43082836, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43082918, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43083850, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43083820)
    *   An alternative to cosine similarity is proposed: using an LLM to grade the "insight" of each step in the chain of thought, which could provide a more semantically relevant measure of progress.
    *   Another suggestion is to visualize the relationships as a graph or tree, connecting similar thoughts to show the flow and branching of the AI's reasoning process, similar to "Trees of Thoughts."
    *   Turning the visualization into a graph by connecting the most similar entries is proposed to illustrate the relationships between thoughts.
    *   The idea of using a three-dimensional space for visualization is suggested as a potential way to represent more complex relationships than a 2D t-SNE plot.

*   **Mixed Reactions and Potential Use Cases** (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43082993)
    *   While acknowledging the methodological concerns about using external embeddings and cosine similarity, some commenters see potential value in the visualization as a "neat loading graphic" for reasoning models.
    *   This suggests that even if the visualization doesn't perfectly represent the AI's internal thought process, it could still have aesthetic or presentational uses in demonstrating AI reasoning.
