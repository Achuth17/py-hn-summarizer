**Summary**

*   George Lucas offered Lynch the job after being impressed by "Eraserhead" and "The Elephant Man".

*   Other directors considered for ROTJ included Richard Donner, John Carpenter, Terry Gilliam, David Cronenberg, Richard Lester, and John Boorman.
*   The article analyzes excerpts from a hypothetical Lynch-directed ROTJ screenplay to illustrate how his style might have influenced the film, focusing on texture, atmosphere, and grotesque elements.
*   The author discusses the various reasons given for Lynch declining, including choosing to direct "Dune" and creative differences regarding music and sound.
