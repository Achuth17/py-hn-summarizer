**Summary**

*   XOR is explained as a boolean logic operator and bitwise operation on integers, relevant for low-level programming but less so for modern high-level programming.
*   XOR is defined by its truth table and described in multiple ways: "Exclusive OR", "not equals" operator, conditional inversion, parity or sum mod 2, and difference mod 2.
*   Key properties of XOR include commutativity, associativity, identity element (0), and self-inverse property.
*   Bitwise XOR applies these properties to integers, operating on each bit independently.
*   Applications of XOR are diverse, including cryptography for keystream ciphers, pixel graphics for reversible drawing, implementing half-adders, and bit swapping techniques.
*   XOR has connections to mathematical concepts such as symmetric difference of sets, groups of exponent 2, Nim-sum in game theory, and the finite field GF(2) which is fundamental in linear algebra, polynomial arithmetic, error-correcting codes, CRCs, and constructing larger finite fields used in cryptography.
