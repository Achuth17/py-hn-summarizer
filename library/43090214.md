    *   The subscription model is a major turn-off and a deal-breaker for many users, especially given the availability of free or cheaper alternatives like PyCharm.
    *   The price is considered too high for an IDE, particularly compared to comprehensive suites like JetBrains.
    *   Users express general fatigue with subscription-based software and a preference for purchasing software outright.
    *   Questions are raised about what happens to user's work if they stop subscribing, specifically regarding the Scripton library and plot outputs.
    *   Some suggest considering a hobbyist or cheaper pricing tier.
    *   The term "SubScripton" is used as a critical play on words.

*   **Platform limitations and request for cross-platform support (Mac-only)** (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43091951, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43093157, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43090907, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43093157)
    *   Being Mac-only is a significant limitation and deal-breaker for users on other operating systems like Linux and Windows.
    *   Users working in cross-platform environments or preferring Linux are unable to use the product in its current state.
    *   The lack of cross-platform support limits the potential user base.

*   **Comparisons to existing IDEs and visualization tools, and suggestions for integration** (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43090844, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43090535, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43091551, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43092970, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43090702, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43090934, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43092573, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43090410, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43094037, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43092367, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43090844)
    *   Users compare Scripton to Spyder, Rerun, Trae, JetBrains Fleet/PyCharm, Matlab, Clerk, VSCode, and Light Table.
    *   Suggestions are made to consider becoming a VSCode extension, a JetBrains plugin, or a standalone Python runner/visualization tool independent of a full IDE.
    *   Rerun is suggested as a strong alternative for data visualization, particularly in robotics and streaming data scenarios.
    *   Concerns are raised about competing with free and established tools, especially with a subscription model.
