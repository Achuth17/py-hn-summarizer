Sample Response given below:

**Summary**

*   Leaders need to repeatedly communicate key messages to their organization for them to be understood and acted upon. This is described as "beating the drum".
*   In large organizations, consistent communication is crucial to keep everyone aligned, as people can easily become out of sync.
*   Simple communication methods like company-wide emails or all-hands meetings often fail due to various reasons: people skimming emails, missing meetings, forgetting messages, disagreeing with the message, or lacking context.
*   Effective communication requires empathy from leaders to understand how their message will be received and internalized by their audience.
*   Leaders should simplify their message, repeat it across different mediums, and ensure consistency to improve understanding and adherence.
*   The core idea is that consistent and repetitive communication, like beating a drum, is necessary for leaders to effectively guide their organizations.

    *   Emails and communications from high-level executives are often seen as vapid, self-congratulatory, and lacking substance.

    *   There's a strong negative sentiment towards high-level business leaders and their perceived lack of contribution.
